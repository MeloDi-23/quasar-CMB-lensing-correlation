TODO:

- calculate high L auto corr, low L auto corr (already done), and high-low cross corr. if there is no systematic they should follow

$$
    wp_{cross} = \sqrt{wp_{high} wp_{low}}
$$

- calculate the Nq to constrain Amp of our HOD.
$$
    n_q = \frac{N_q}{V}; V = \frac{1}{3}\Omega (\chi_2^2 - \chi_1^2)
    n_q = \int A f(m) \frac{dn_h}{dm}dm
$$
and sigma(n_q) can be estimated using jackknife. it can also be added to covariance matrix.
